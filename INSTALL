= Installing the screenshot factory on Linux =

This page has been updated to work with Browsershots 0.4.

== Install prerequisites ==

{{{
sudo apt-get install tightvncserver netpbm xautomation scrot
}}}

== Get the screenshot factory source code ==

{{{
svn checkout http://svn.browsershots.org/branches/shotfactory-django
}}}

== Adjust config files ==

Change the file '''~/.vnc/xstartup''' to the following three lines. This 
will set a white background and then run nothing except the window manager. 
Be sure to remove any reference to xterm because it gets in the way.

{{{
#!/bin/sh
xsetroot -solid "#FFFFFF"
x-window-manager &
}}}

== Run ==

{{{
cd shotfactory-django
screen -L python shotfactory.py
}}}

== Troubleshooting ==

 * Run '''shotfactory.py -v''' (or '''--verbose''') to see more output, 
including error messages from helper programs.
 * Run '''shotfactory.py -h''' (or '''--help''') to see a list of command 
line options.
 * While a screenshot request is being processed, you can run '''xvncviewer 
:1''' to see the virtual screen of the VNC server.
 * The file '''shotfactory.log''' contains error messages for failed 
screenshot requests.
 * If you use '''screen -L''', the file '''screenlog.0''' will contain the 
full output of the shotfactory script.
